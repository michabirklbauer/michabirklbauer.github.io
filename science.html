          <p>
            <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
            This paper describes how promoter genes can be effectively and efficiently predicted
            given data in the form of a nucleic acid sequence. This is of utter significance as the
            number of uncurated, daily submitted sequences (to biological databases) increased
            exponentially over the last few years. Predicting promoter (and
            other) genes could automate the process of curating sequences and therefore decrease
            the number of uncurated submissions. In my approach I trained a support vector
            machine, a kind of machine learning model, on sequences with labels referring to their
            status of being/containing a promoter gene or not. Furthermore I used several different
            kernels to calculate sequence similarities. The goal was to optimize the hyperparameter
            settings to maximize the number of correctly predicted sequences in a five-fold cross
            validation setup. Ultimately this was achieved using a mismatch kernel with
            hyperparameters k=8 and m=2 for calculating sequence similarity and pattern finding.
            For realizing the model the support vector machine was using the “LiblineaR” kernel
            package and applied a costfactor of 5. This altogether yielded a result of 65 out of 100
            correctly predicted genes. To further improve the encountered error I used an ensemble
            method called voting to combine three different support vector machines, which further
            improved the result. Additionally to the mentioned mismatch kernel support vector
            machine, one with a spectrum kernel with k=4 was used. As the third contributing
            support vector machine again a mismatch kernel was used, this time however with
            hyperparameters set to k=6, m=1 and a costfactor of 10. All three support vector
            machines achieved similar results as standalones, each raising errors of about 35% in
            the standard five-fold cross validation setup. The vote mechanism was carried out using
            a simple majority vote, meaning that the winner takes all and no additional information
            (e.g. reliability) is returned by the algorithm. This setup proved to be better than using
            only one support vector machine and predicted 74 out of 100 genes correctly, decreasing
            the observed error by 9%. The final results showed that promoter genes can only be
            successfully predicted by support vector machines up to a certain point. Unfortunately
            74% accuracy is definitely not meeting industrial- and scientific standards when it
            comes to curating sequences, however it still can be a major assistance to manual
            curation.

          <p>
            <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
            Motivation: Imputation of missing data is a crucial step in data analysis since many statistical
            methods require complete datasets. In that regard MissForest is a powerful imputation method that
            seems to outperform most other imputation approaches. My analysis evaluates how good
            imputation using MissForest is compared to standard strawman (mean) imputation in a clinical
            dataset that is used to predict the mortality of patients after heart valve surgery. <br>
            Result: The models that were trained on the MissForest imputed dataset outperformed the models
            that were imputed by strawman imputation in terms of area under the ROC curve and balanced
            accuracy but there was no improvement when it comes to accuracy. An analysis of means however
            showed that there was no significant improvement in prediction accuracy overall in our models.
            The reason for that might be that the data in our clinical dataset might not be missing at random.
